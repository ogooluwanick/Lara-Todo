# Lara-Todo

### Description

Learning Laravel by building a very basic Todo app with what I've learnt so far.  I found it difficult to deploy this project although it works fine on my PC, looking forward to being able to rectify this issue very soon.

### Installation

You can clone this project and run it in as a laravel project. You will need to create your own mysql DB(or any other DB you can use on Laravel, SQLlite wink wink)https://github.com/ogooluwanick/Lara-Todo).
